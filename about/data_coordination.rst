Data Coordination
=================

We provide focused support for scientific projects and initiatives through our Data Coordination programme, in which we collaborate with partners across and beyond the life sciences to support the application of molecular methods. Addressing the challenges of data-intensive methods, interdisciplinary science, multi-omics and complex and deep data, we typically provide web and programmatic platforms for data sharing and publication, comprising tools, analysis support, cloud compute accessibility, data navigation and visualisation systems and user training and support.

Current Data Coordination projects include
