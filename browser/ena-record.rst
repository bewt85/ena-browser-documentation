Viewing ENA Records
===================

ENA Records
===========

You can view any public ENA records using their Accession (unique identifier) or 
as the result of a search.

Exploring an ENA record
-----------------------

.. image:: images/record-guide.png

All records have a selection of standard, indexed metadata which tells you about the 
database entry. For example, where it is submitted, basic information on the record's 
title and description etc.

For more information about this record, you can click *Show More* to access additional data 
that the data submitter has provided.

To explore a record further, you can use the navigation box in the top right of the view 
to show/hide different additional subsections of information.

This gives you access to any other associated data, such as if a project has any data 
files or publications associated with it.

Any links that looks like *accessions* (a series of letters then numbers) will take you 
to an associated record.

An ENA record can be one of the following types:

Navigation and Cross References
===============================

From here you can navigate through all associated records that were submitted within the same 
submission Project.

Organisation of a Project in ENA
--------------------------------

.. image:: images/metadata-model.png

When data is submitted to the archive, the data submitter establishes relationships 
between the records so someone viewing the data can easily navigate between the records. 
This makes it easy to explore the data generated from biological samples which were 
sequenced/analysed within the same research project.

Cross-references
----------------

From this tab you can also see any links from the record out to external data resources 
that have used or generate these records as part of their services. These links are generated 
as part of ENA's cross-reference service and so only show data from resources that are 
registered with us. You can see more details on what services are 
registered `here <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/xref>`_.

*Note: This view only gives a snapshot of the associated records submitted as part of the 
originally submitted research project and any registered cross-references. For a view 
showing all ENA records which are associated with this record (including any other 
links to this record within other ENA submission projects), you can see this in the Portal 
Links tab (available for Project, Sample and Taxon records).*

Read Files
==========

Display and download any associated raw read files.

You can download a Report of all the data displayed in the table or download files selected 
from the table. To download all files in the column, click the download icon in the table 
header.

To choose additional metadata to add to the table display and report, use the 'Show selected 
columns' expandable menu.


Analysis Files
==============

Display and download any associated analysis files.

You can download a Report of all the data displayed in the table or download files selected 
from the table. To download all files in the column, click the download icon in the table 
header.

To choose additional metadata to add to the table display and report, use the 'Show selected 
columns' expandable menu.


Publications
============

Explore publications that either cite the record or where the record was generated.

This view provides links to the DOI or in some cases, a direct link to the PDF or article in 
Europe PMC.


Component Projects
==================

In the case of an **Umbrella Project** (a project which is used to group many related 
sub-projects) there is the option to explore its Component Projects.

Component projects are the same as other project records in ENA but are grouped under one 
'umbrella' meaning they will often have the same research motivation and will often represent 
a collaborative research effort.
