ENA Records
===========

You can view any public ENA records using their Accession (unique identifier) or 
as the result of a search.

Exploring an ENA record
-----------------------

.. image:: images/record-guide.png

All records have a selection of standard, indexed metadata which tells you about the 
database entry. For example, where it is submitted, basic information on the record's 
title and description etc.

For more information about this record, you can click *Show More* to access additional data 
that the data submitter has provided.

To explore a record further, you can use the navigation box in the top right of the view 
to show/hide different additional subsections of information.

This gives you access to any other associated data, such as if a project has any data 
files or publications associated with it.

Any links that looks like *accessions* (a series of letters then numbers) will take you 
to an associated record.

An ENA record can be one of the following types:
