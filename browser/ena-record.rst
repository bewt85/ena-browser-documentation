Viewing ENA Records
===================

ENA Records
===========

You can view any public ENA records using their Accession (unique identifier) or 
as the result of a search.

An ENA record can be one of the following types:

- **Project/Study:** This record represents a biological research project. It holds all the 
  ENA records (e.g. samples, raw reads, analyses for one study together).
- **Sample:** This record represents a biological sample used for a sequencing experiment.
- **Run/Experiment:** These records represent the sequencing event and associated raw 
  read files generated.
- **Analysis:** These records represent any downstream analyses performed on sequencing data.
- **WGS set:** These records represent Whole Genome Sequencing contig sets generated as part of 
  a genome assembly.
- **Assembly:** These records represent an entire genome or transcriptome assembly which could 
  be made up of contigs, scaffolds or full chromosomes.
- **Sequence:** These records represent assembled or annotated sequences generated from 
  sequencing data. These can anything from coding to non-coding regions or barcoding sequences.
- **Taxon:** These records represent taxa from the NCBI taxonomy database and hold information 
  on the organism that the record was derived from or deduced to be. All samples have a taxon 
  and as a result, all associated data is associated with a taxon record.

Exploring an ENA record
-----------------------

All records have a selection of standard, indexed metadata which tells you about the 
database entry. For example, where it is submitted, basic information on the record's 
title and description etc.

For more information about this record, you can click *Show More* to access additional data 
that the data submitter has provided.

To explore a record further, you can use the navigation box in the top right of the view 
to show/hide different additional subsections of information.

This gives you access to any other associated data, such as if a project has any data 
files or publications associated with it.

Any links that looks like *accessions* (a series of letters then numbers) will take you 
to an associated record.
