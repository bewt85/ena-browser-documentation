# Taxon Portal

The taxon portal refers to two things:

1. Performing taxonomic searches
2. Accessing all information about a given taxon including all public data associated with the organism.

## Taxonomic Searches

To perform a search for taxa, please go to the [Advanced Search UI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/advanced-search)
and select txon in the datatype dropdown. Click Next.

Click on the filter group Taxonomy and related.

In the Query builder Select filter dropdown, select NCBI Taxonomy. In the text field start typing in the taxon of interest.
A list of suggestions will pop up so that you can select th one you want. The Query box will be automatically populated.

If you wish to search taxa over a lineage of the taxonomic tree, please tick the “Include subordinate taxa” box.

Further customise your search using the Next button, or hit Search. In the results view you can click on the taxon Id to
go to the record view page.

The record view page for every taxon contains a Portal Links display.  This portal provides access to all public ENA
data that are classified as belonging to the taxa being viewed,
or to the full taxonomic subtree starting from the node in question.  With the portal table, the number of objects are
listed and these are linked to search result-like listings of all data that can be browsed, viewed or downloaded.
