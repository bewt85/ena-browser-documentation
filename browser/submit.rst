Data Submission and Updates
===========================

Introduction
============

We offer a number of services through which data (including 
updates) can be submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive 
(ENA). These technologies provide options appropriate for 
the scale and frequency of submission, the expertise and 
capacity of the submitter and the nature of the data to be 
transferred. The choices below lead users most directly to 
the appropriate submission route.

Submitting data to ENA
======================

From the data submission page you can access all of our 
submission services directly and access the submission guidelines 
available `here <https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide.html>`_.
