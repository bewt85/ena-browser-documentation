Introduction
============

The ENA is retiring its periodic assembled/annotated sequence release in March 2020,the last release will be number 143.

The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) captures, preserves and presents the world's nucleotide sequence data. Since 1982 the European Nucleotide Archive has made 140 individual releases, providing a quarterly snapshot of ENA assembled/annotated sequence data. During this time, changes to the ways in which users access ENA data, have led us to develop a portfolio of data access tools, such as our daily FTP products and the ENA Browser API, which are currently offered in parallel to the traditional release.  In recent years we have faced growing pressure on the release process in response to increases in data volume and have also seen a shift towards our newer services from the majority of users. Our release process has remained largely unchanged for the last two decades, and following an internal review we have concluded that it is no longer viable for us to continue the current release process as part of our presentation portfolio.

New data is already included in the ENA on a continuous basis and distributed daily from our browser, FTP and RESTful API services. The key change is that we will no longer make an additional separate quarterly release of the assembled/annotated subset of sequences. We will focus our resources on further developing and supporting our continuous distribution presentation products.

As part of the release retirement we will no longer be creating cumulative FTP files in the FTP update folders (e.g. http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/sequence/update/). These cumulative files tracked daily changes inbetween release cycles and thus cannot continue to be produced sustainably. Release 143 will be the last available in the release folder (available here once released http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/sequence/release/), the update folder will be removed after this last release. Set based sequences have already been removed from the release and will continue to be added to the FTP in their corresponding folders (e.g. http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/wgs/public/).

After the final release in March 2020 we will be merging the '_release' and '_update' data types for sequence, coding and non-coding. So the data types'sequence_release' and 'sequence_update' will be replaced with the data type 'sequence'. This affects users of our API and browser advanced search services, you will need to use the updated data type end points. The new data types will be available in parallel ahead of the switchover so we advise switching ahead of March 2020.

The following guide has been created to assist users in moving away from the release. This guide outlines accessing assembled/annotated sequences, guidance on how to identify data based on a last updated timestamp and advice for establishing your own mirroring procedures using our portfolio of other access services. 

Accessing assembled/annotated sequences
=======================================
..Edit if we are to discontinue FTP, following resolution of meeting about continutation of this service.
Assembled/annotated sequences can be obtained from our our continuous daily distribution resources, with API, FTP and web browser based options. For most use cases we would recommend the ENA Browser API as it provides the greatest specificity and flexibiluty for obtaining a tailored dataset of assembled/annotated sequences for your requirements.

ENA API
-------
Assembled/annotated sequences can be identified and downloaded with our `ENA Browser API <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/>`_. The https API Swagger interface provides documentation on the endpoints, expected usage and errors.

Example of obtaining a single record by accession:
In EMBL format:

.. code-block:: curl
curl -X GET "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/embl/BN000065?download=true&lineLimit=0" -H "accept: text/plain"

In FASTA format

.. code-block:: curl
curl -X GET "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/BN000065?download=true&lineLimit=0" -H "accept: text/plain"

..Update the data type to sequence in below examples once DCP-2172 is complete
The ENA Browser API also allows the user to conduct a search for multiple Assembled/annotated sequences records and download them. In this example searching the sequence data type for human data distributed or updated since 19th August 2019:
In EMBL format
.. code-block:: wget
wget 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/embl/search?result=sequence_update&query=tax_eq(9606)%20AND%20last_updated%3C%3D2019-08-18&limit=5' -O embl.txt
or
.. code-block:: curl
curl 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/embl/search?result=sequence_update&query=tax_eq(9606)%20AND%20last_updated%3C%3D2019-08-18&limit=5' -o embl.txt

In FASTA format
.. code-block:: wget
wget 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/search?result=sequence_update&query=tax_eq(9606)%20AND%20last_updated%3C%3D2019-08-18&limit=5' -O fasta.txt
or
.. code-block:: curl
curl 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/search?result=sequence_update&query=tax_eq(9606)%20AND%20last_updated%3C%3D2019-08-18&limit=5' -o fasta.txt

We have added limits to the above examples to only return 5 records, remove this under normal use. You can search using the sequence, coding or non-coding data type endpoints. In general when using the API search it is important to be as specific as possible with your query to save on downloading sequences that you do not require.

.. read current release notes on data types to help here.

..Edit if we are to discontinue FTP, following resolution of meeting about continutation of this service.
ENA FTP
-------
Alternatively assembled/annotated sequence files our distributed daily to the `ENA FTP service <http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/sequence/>`_. 

The release folders, for example the sequence release folder (http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/sequence/release/) will contain the final release 143 made in March 2020.

..how to download distributed files, if we continue this service.
..mention aspera download as alternative for large downlaods as more stable?

How to identify data based on a last updated timestamp
======================================================
A typical use of the release was to obtain data changes since a given timestamp.

..Example of supplying timestamp.
.. code-block:: curl

curl 'https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/search?result=sequence_update&query=last_updated%3C%3D2019-08-18&limit=5' -o fasta.txt

You can also provide a date limiter to give a specific range rather than all data to this date

..Example

.. Give link for more information on any API when DCP-2176 is complete


Establishing your own mirroring procedures
==========================================
.. Use API or advacned search to create a query with a to and from date.

..Optional, Start portal API to get accessions. If you customise the field output make sure you include sequence version.

..You can then get them from browser API.

..BUT more efficnet to rerun query on browser API. more efficient.

..Importantly record the timestamp from when you run the current query and store this so that you can use it for your next update. Obviously you can now pick an update frequency that most suits your use case, by 

..If you are wanting to establish 

..So if you want a list of everything, use the portal API report. Same query against discovery API to get list of accessions, then same query against broswer API to get flat files.

..Note make sure you run the query direct on 

..The reason you genreate the report is that if you repeat the same search at alater date you may get different results becuase some records may have been updated or supressed. 

..The important for your users is to provide the report you generated earlier, they can then get a better reconstruction of the same dataset as it will contain supressed records. Killed records can never be retrieved.

..For large downlaods we would advise parallel downloads, instructions on how to do this.

..If you need to resume a download, we currently would recomended using a grep to caculate how many you got, show instructions, and then use offset, please be aware data may have changed inbetween the call.

.. Describe new endpoint that will tell you if any records in report file have been updated supressed or killed since it was genreated.

.. Describe how you can use the report to get the exact same versions as the mirror download

.. example of a query with a to and from date

.. State that it is better to be very specific with the query for what is actually required for your release, if you only need a certain data type, data from a certain taxon or from a partouclar region then you should limit this in your query, instructions for construting queries here.


.. Comment that RuleSpace can be used to save a complex query for repeated use

.. Comment that we may establish partitions for users depending on requirements.

.. Give link for more information on any APIs or tech used above
