Moving away from the release
============================

Introduction
============

The ENA is retiring its periodic assembled/annotated sequence release in March 2020, with the last release number 143.

The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) captures, preserves and presents the world's nucleotide sequence data. Since 1982 the European Nucleotide Archive has made 140 individual releases, providing a quarterly snapshot of ENA assembled/annotated sequence data. During this time, changes to the ways in which users access ENA data, have led us to develop a portfolio of data access tools, such as our daily FTP products and the ENA Browser API, which are currently offered in parallel to the traditional release.  In recent years we have faced growing pressure on the release process in response to increases in data volume and have also seen a shift towards our newer services from the majority of users. Our release process has remained largely unchanged for the last two decades, and following an internal review we have concluded that it is no longer viable for us to continue the current release process as part of our presentation portfolio.

New data is already included in the ENA on a continuous basis and distributed daily from our browser, FTP and RESTful API services. The key change is that we will no longer make an additional separate quarterly release of the assembled/annotated subset of sequences. We will focus our resources on further developing and supporting our continuous distribution presentation products.

The following guide has been created to assist users in moving away from the release. This guide outlines accessing assembled/annotated sequences, guidance on how to identify data based on a last updated timestamp and advice for establishing your own mirroring procedures using our portfolio of other access services.

Further assistance
==================
If you currently rely on any aspect of the separate assembled/annotated sequence release process for your work or resource, and cannot switch to one of our continuous distribution processes outlined above, please feel free to contact us to discuss your requirements. 

In your query please list what features you utilised from the release process. We can discuss your requirements and determine how we might support your use case through one of our existing services or collaborate on an adapted or novel solution. Contacting us promptly with your requirements will allow us to ensure adequate time and resources to collaborate on a solution.
